Description:
    GRIWM etimates extinction time from fossil data. Observations are weighted inversely by their temporal distance from
    the last observation of a species occurrence, such that dates nearer to the last observation have heavier weights. Dates
    *with associated radiometric errors* (i.e., with standard deviations reported) are resampled from an underlying fossilization
    probability distribution, here assumed to be Gaussian.
